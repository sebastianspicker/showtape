# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Documentation & Cleanup

- Product docs consolidated: PRD is now the single source for problem, scope, stories, onboarding and success metrics.
- Redundant docs removed from `docs/product-specs` and `docs/design-docs`.
- Added `scripts/cleanup-repo.sh` and root script `pnpm cleanup:repo` for local artifact cleanup.

### Platform & Tooling

- Upgraded `apps/web` to Next.js `16.x` and moved app-level edge logic from deprecated `middleware.ts` to `src/proxy.ts`.
- Migrated web lint script from `next lint` to ESLint CLI.
- Added `@repo/ui` as a web dependency and unified button primitive usage.

### API & Error Semantics

- Added structured API error payload support with optional `code` in shared types.
- Added dev-token endpoint rate limiting (`429`, `Retry-After`, `RATE_LIMIT` code).
- Unified API route helpers for `OPTIONS` and internal error responses.
- Setlist proxy now returns structured errors with mapped codes (`BAD_REQUEST`, `NOT_FOUND`, `RATE_LIMIT`, `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`).

### Refactor & Features

- Refactored MusicKit integration into modules (`token`, `client`, `catalog`, `playlist`) behind a stable barrel.
- Split matching flow into dedicated hook/components:
  - `useMatchingSuggestions`
  - `MatchingBulkActions`
  - `MatchRowItem`
  - `TrackSearchPanel`
- Added matching bulk actions: refresh suggestions, skip unmatched, reset all.
- Added import history with local persistence and quick re-import actions.
- Added export QoL features:
  - Optional ordered track dedupe before playlist creation.
  - Session-based resume for failed "add tracks" operations.

### Core Utilities & Tests

- Added `@repo/core` utilities:
  - `buildPlaylistName`
  - `dedupeTrackIdsOrdered`
  - `getSetlistSignature`
- Expanded tests in `packages/core` and `apps/web` (rate limiter).

## [0.2.1] – 2026-03-22

### Added

- Testing infrastructure: `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `jsdom`
- Component tests: `useFlowState` (6), `useMatchingSuggestions` (6), `SetlistImportView` (5), `MatchingView` (3)
- CSP middleware tests (8) verifying all security headers and directives
- RTL smoke test for infrastructure verification

### Fixed

- Accessibility: search result buttons now have descriptive `aria-label` attributes
- Dynamic import loading fallbacks now use `StatusText` component for visual consistency
- `console.error` in error boundary gated to development mode only
- Removed redundant `.then((value) => value)` in `useAsyncAction`
- Added `settled` flag to `waitForMusicKit` timeout to prevent resolve/reject race

## [0.2.0] – 2026-03-22

### Fixed

- MusicKit `writeResume` now handles `QuotaExceededError` gracefully instead of crashing
- Replaced inline type assertion in `playlist.ts` with proper `MusicKitAddTracksResponse` type

### Security

- Added Content-Security-Policy middleware with MusicKit CDN and Apple API whitelist
- Added `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy` headers via middleware

### Testing

- Added MusicKit client integration tests (init, cache, failure reset, concurrency, missing config)

## [0.1.0] – Initial

- Initial monorepo structure: apps (web, api), packages (core, shared, ui), docs, infra, scripts.
