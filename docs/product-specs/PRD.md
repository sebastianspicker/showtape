# Product Requirements Document – Setlist to Playlist

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-02

---

## Overview / Vision

Setlist to Playlist is a PWA that turns a setlist from [setlist.fm](https://www.setlist.fm) (by URL or setlist ID) into an **Apple Music** playlist in the user's account. The user pastes a link, reviews and optionally corrects track matches, then creates the playlist in one flow—no account on our side, no manual copy-paste into Apple Music.

---

## Problem Statement

Concert-goers and fans want to listen to the exact setlist of a show. setlist.fm holds crowd-sourced setlists, but turning that into a playable playlist (e.g. in Apple Music) is manual and tedious. We want one flow: paste a setlist URL or ID, review and optionally fix track matches, then create the playlist in the user's Apple Music library.

---

## Users

- **End user:** Music fan with an Apple Music subscription. They discover a setlist on setlist.fm and want a playlist in their library. No account or sign-up on our service; they use Apple Music (MusicKit) for identity and playback only.

---

## Goals and Non-Goals

**In scope (MVP):**

- One URL or setlist ID in; preview of artist, venue, date, and ordered tracks.
- For each track, suggest an Apple Music match; user can confirm or manually correct/search.
- On confirmation, create an Apple Music playlist and add the selected tracks in order.

**Out of scope (MVP):**

- Multiple setlists in one session, merge setlists, or batch import.
- Persisting setlists or playlists on our side; no user accounts on our platform.
- Offline creation of playlists (export requires network and Apple Music auth).

---

## User Stories

- As a user, I can paste a setlist.fm URL (or setlist ID) and see the setlist (artist, venue, date, tracks).
- As a user, I can see suggested Apple Music matches for each track and correct or search for a different track.
- As a user, I can create an Apple Music playlist with the matched tracks in setlist order.
- As a user, I am not required to create an account on our service; I use my Apple Music account only.

## New User Onboarding (first-session expectations)

1. Open app and read short 4-step explanation.
2. Paste setlist URL or ID.
3. Review imported setlist and continue to matching.
4. Connect Apple Music when needed.
5. Create playlist and optionally open it in Apple Music.

---

## User Flow

1. **Import** – User enters setlist.fm URL or setlist ID.
2. **Preview** – App shows artist, venue, date, and ordered list of tracks.
3. **Match** – For each track, app suggests an Apple Music match; user can accept or change/search.
4. **Create playlist** – User clicks "Create playlist"; after Apple Music authorization if needed, the playlist is created and tracks are added in order.

**Error handling:** Invalid URL/ID or setlist not found → clear message. No match for a track → user can search manually or skip. Apple Music auth failed or revoked → prompt to re-authorize.

---

## Success Criteria

- User can complete the flow (import → preview → match → export) for a typical setlist in under a few minutes.
- No secrets (API keys, Apple private key) exposed to the client.

### Success Metrics

- **Completion rate:** % of users who start (enter URL) and finish (playlist created).
- **Time to playlist:** Median time from URL entry to playlist created.
- **Match quality:** % of tracks auto-matched without user correction (informational; corrections are expected).
- **Reliability:** API uptime and setlist-proxy success rate.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                                        | Mitigation                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| setlist.fm rate limits / API availability   | Proxy caches responses (1 h TTL); backoff on 429; clear error message to user. |
| Apple Music catalog gaps (live/rare tracks) | Show "No match"; allow manual search or skip.                                  |
| User revokes MusicKit authorization         | Detect auth errors; show clear re-auth prompt.                                 |

---

## Dependencies / Integrations

- **setlist.fm API:** Fetch setlist by ID (or parse ID from URL). API key used server-side only (proxy). See [setlist.fm (tech)](../tech/setlistfm.md).
- **Apple Music:** MusicKit JS in the client; Developer Token from our API (JWT, server-side); User Token from MusicKit after user authorizes. See [Apple Music (tech)](../tech/apple-music.md).
